Aniplot Stream is a full-stack anime-style streaming platform where users can create accounts, upload original videos, and watch content in a smooth, organized interface. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and modern web technologies, the platform allows secure user authentication, video uploads, and online streaming directly from the browser. Users can register, log in, upload their own original episodes or animations, and watch videos in a simple, fast video player. This project is designed as a complete streaming system with backend storage, session management, and a working upload system — making it a real developer-level web application.
